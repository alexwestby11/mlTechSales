# ML Tech Sales

Machine Learning Technology Sales is a user-friendly interface for consumers who are looking
to purchase tech products. This interface will allow users to easily search the latest and additional
product system components without any prior research. This interface will use machine learning
in the back-end to suggest related technologies and supporting devices that will fit the products
that consumers search for, while maintaining a simple interface that the user can easily navigate.
The Machine Learning Technology Sales interface will empower the common consumer with the
purchasing decisions similar to that of a specialist.
